## WHY?

Hello and thanks for downloading this file for 3D printing
your own **Charybdis Mini Travel Case** for your keyboard!!

I have a Charybdis mini wireless keyboard and I was not
happy with the lack of options for protecting it during my
commutes. Working in an IT company means that some days
it is office and some others it is working from home. Since
Charybdis mini is my favorite keyboard I really needed a way
to carry it safely.

I had in mind a very curvy and organic travel case that fitted
perfectly the keyboard. **More than 50 hours of design and
lots of filament in prototypes** were invested to get the final
result. Now I can throw my keyboard with the travel case
inside my backpack when commuting and it is perfectly
protected. Each side is formed by two pieces that snap
together perfectly with **6mm diameter and 3mm height
magnets**. All the design was done in **Shapr3D on my iPad
Pro** , which BTW is an amazing tool.

Case was designed with my keycaps in mind. I have tried both
**XDA and HSA keycaps and it fits great**. You may need to
adapt the base of the keyboard for fitting your own keycaps,
especially if you use SA or MT3 or some tall keycaps.

## CONTENTS OF THIS

## ZIP FILE:

**ReadMeFirst.pdf** This File

**Pictures** Some pictures are included in this
zip file.

**Flat version** folder Flat version of the bottom part, no
flange. Base should be easier to
adapt and modify, even for Flange
version if needed.

Top cases (3MF)

Bottom cases (3MF, STEP editable file)

**Flange version** folder Version with a flange on the
bottom part, which is easier to
open by using your thumb in the
flange. It is also more aesthetically
pleasing if you print both parts in
different colors.

Does this mean I can print it and use it for free? Yes! But I
would like to ask you for a couple of things:

1. Please follow my instagram @CASLArt3D for more designs
like this
2. If you like this and find this useful I would really appreciate
if you could buy me a coffee, this will help me a lot with future
designs.
3. Please share your print on your social media and tag me!!!
Thanks!!


## HOW TO PRINT:

**PLA with 0.4 nozzle and 0.08** layer height

Best approach so far that I have found to print the case is:

- **Top parts** , Vertically, using the small cut surface for the
    flange in the thumb cluster and use tree organic supports.
    There will be some minor marks in the outside of the case
    because of the contact with the bed and some external
    supports, but for the rest of the print it will be perfect.
    Please see the version with the stripes for orientation. You
    can also print the non flanged yellow top case like this. As
    an alternative, you can print it flat (please see yellow top
    cases in the image but some marks due to resolution will
    appear on the top surface)
- **Bottom parts** , lay them naturally on the printing bed

##### Also something that worked well for me is to

##### disable the options Speed - Overhang speed -

##### Slow down for overhangs and Slow down for

##### curled perimeters in Orca Slicer



## FINAL WORDS

I have invested a lot of work on this case and I am really
proud of the results.

Again, thanks a lot for your support, it does mean a lot to me.
Following my instagram @CASLArt3D or buying me a coffee
in Buymeacoffee will help me a lot to create even more
amazing designs.

Hope you enjoy your **Charybdis Mini Travel Case** !!
