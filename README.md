I have a Charybdis mini wireless keyboard and I was not happy with the lack of options for protecting it during my commutes. Working in an IT company means that some days it is office and some others it is working from home. Since Charybdis mini is my favorite keyboard I really needed a way to carry it safely.
I had in mind a very curvy and organic travel case that fitted perfectly the keyboard. More than 50 hours of design and lots of filament in prototypes were invested to get the final result. Now I can throw my keyboard with the travel case inside my backpack when commuting and it is perfectly protected. Each side is formed by two pieces that snap together perfectly with 6mm diameter and 3mm height magnets. All the design was done in Shapr3D on my iPad Pro, which BTW is an amazing tool. 
Case was designed with my keycaps in mind. I have tried both XDA and HSA keycaps and it fits great. You may need to adapt the base of the keyboard for fitting your own keycaps, especially if you use SA or MT3 or some tall keycaps.
